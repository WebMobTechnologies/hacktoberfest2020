## What's Hacktoberfest?
[Hacktoberfest ‚Äî brought to you by DigitalOcean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) in partnership with [DEV](https://dev.to/) ‚Äî is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors toward issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small ‚Äî bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

This year, [WebMob Technologies](https://webmobtech.com/) will hold the third official Hacktoberfest event in Ahmedabad. **The event takes place on October 10**.

Can't make it to this event? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe. Sign up to participate today at [https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com.](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

## Rules and prizes
To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make **four pull requests (PRs)** between **October 1-31 (in any time zone)**. PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt.
